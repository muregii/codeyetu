# Vision
In an Agile way, develop a robust web application that will serve as the CodeKenya website, while decomposing the development process into a commercializable syllabus.

## Principles of Agile

### Define User Stories with Acceptance Criteria
- **What to do:** Break down features into user stories with clear acceptance criteria to ensure each functionality meets the intended purpose.
- **Example:** A user story might be, "As a prospective student, I want to view a list of available programs so that I can select one that aligns with my goals." The acceptance criteria could specify that the list should load within 2 seconds, display program details, and have a filter by location.

### Prioritize Features in the Product Backlog
- **What to do:** Order features in the backlog based on user value and project goals, ensuring the most critical features are developed first.
- **Example:** Prioritize the homepage and program listing pages before building additional features like blogs or student portals to ensure users get the essential content.

### Iterate in Sprints
- **What to do:** Break down the project into sprints (usually 1-4 weeks), each focused on completing a set of user stories.
- **Example:** In the first sprint, focus on building a basic version of the homepage and program page, then collect feedback to enhance it in the next sprint.

### Daily Standups
- **What to do:** Hold daily meetings with the team to discuss progress, blockers, and planned work for the day.
- **Example:** During a standup, a developer might mention they‚Äôre waiting on a design for the "About Us" page, allowing the designer to prioritize it.

### Regular Feedback Loops with Stakeholders
- **What to do:** Involve stakeholders in sprint reviews or demos to gather feedback and make adjustments.
- **Example:** After a sprint, showcase the program listing page to stakeholders, gather feedback on the layout and information presented, and incorporate suggested changes in the next sprint.

### Continuous Testing and Integration
- **What to do:** Regularly test features as they‚Äôre developed, catching bugs early through automated testing and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Example:** Implement tests for each user story, such as verifying that the application form correctly saves user inputs and flags invalid entries.

### Retrospectives for Continuous Improvement
- **What to do:** Hold retrospectives at the end of each sprint to discuss what went well, what could improve, and what changes to make.
- **Example:** After the first sprint, the team realizes that unclear user story details led to rework, so they decide to include acceptance criteria reviews in sprint planning.

### Allow for Scope Changes and Reprioritization
- **What to do:** Be open to changing the backlog priorities as user feedback and market insights emerge.
- **Example:** After gathering feedback, the team learns that users want more details on internship opportunities, so they prioritize building an internship page earlier than planned.

### Deliver Incremental Releases
- **What to do:** Release usable parts of the application incrementally to gain real user feedback early and often.
- **Example:** Release the core pages‚Äîhome, programs, and admissions‚Äîwhile still developing secondary features like the blog or contact pages, allowing prospective students to browse the primary content right away.

### Documentation of Agile Processes and Decisions
- **What to do:** Maintain lightweight, regularly updated documentation on the project‚Äôs goals, user stories, sprint progress, and decisions.
- **Example:** Document each sprint‚Äôs objectives, completed user stories, and any adjustments to the backlog, helping team members understand the project‚Äôs evolving direction without lengthy documentation.

## Product Backlog

### Frontend

### User Stories
 - As a user, I should be able to find an apply button, fill in my name, school, and program of interest, write my formal essay application, upload supporting documents and submit my application. Once approved, I should get a notification that will allow me to now access the payment page where I should be able to pay for the program after the submission.

### Acceptance criteria
 - The UX has to be üëå
 - A button clearly labelled APPLY
 -

- Create the repository.


# Next.js Project

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with `create-next-app`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses `next/font` to automatically optimize and load *Geist*, a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - Learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - An interactive Next.js tutorial.
- [Next.js GitHub Repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - Your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the Vercel Platform from the creators of Next.js.

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
